Description: Implements the partial identification approach for regression
    discontinuity designs when units may manipulate the running variable.
    Provides functions to estimate bounds for sharp and fuzzy designs,
    utilities for density estimation, simulation helpers and a bootstrap
    routine for confidence intervals.
